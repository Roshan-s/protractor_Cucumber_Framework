/*
 Author      : Roshan S.
 Description : Hooks are blocks of code that can run at various points in the Cucumber execution cycle.
               They are typically used for setup and teardown of the environment before and after each scenario.
               Where a hook is defined has no impact on what scenarios or steps it is run for.
